# GL Book

Book a workout with Goodlife. The main usecase is to book workouts in advance automatically.

## Guide
Set up the parameters according to the docstring. Then simply:
```shell
python src/book.py
```

## TODOs
- Support selecting gyms (only allowing the main gym for now)
- Email notification on success/failure
- Support other browsers (Safari only for now)
- Check availability of time slots
